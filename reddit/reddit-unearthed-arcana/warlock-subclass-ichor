			<p>Your patron isn't distant like the patrons of other warlocks, your patron lives within you. Through some means you've forged a deal with a living ichor, you act as its host and help it sustain itself and it in return grants you power. Through you, your patron tastes, smells, sees, and feels the world as you do through your senses. Your patron could be a sentient mimic, an oblex, the blood of a deity, or perhaps an alien entity from the stars.</p>
